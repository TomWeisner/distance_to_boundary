# distance_to_boundary
Determines the minimum distance of a point P to a curve in 2 dimensions.

This distance can be 'normalised' by dividing by the maximum possible distance from the curve to an enclosing
border (i.e axis bounds), allowing for a set of points to compare their proportional projections into respective regions.
